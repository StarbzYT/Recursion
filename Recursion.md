Recursion

What is recursion?
A process (function in our case) that calls itself.

Advantages of Recursion:

Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.
Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.

Disadvantages of Recursion:
Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.
Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.
Recursive functions are hard to debug.

What is the time complexity of recursive functions?

The time complexity, in Big O notation, for each function, is in numerical order: The first function is being called recursively n times before reaching base case so its O(n) (linear time).

It shows up a lot and many functions built into python are recursive, including algorithms!
